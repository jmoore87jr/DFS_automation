get_projections.py gets DFS projections from a website of your choosing, then uses the pydfs-lineup-optimizer package to generate optimal lineups and save them to a .csv.

I don't have time to do my own work anymore, but sweats are still fun. I'd like to create something that lets me push a button and alter as many lineups as I want to right before lock. The pydfs-lineup-optimizer package makes this pretty straightforward.

Most of the functional things are in place, but the project is not fully operational yet. If you run it now, it will optimize lineups for season average points, not projected points. 

Upcoming changes:

* Join projections to the DraftKings export sheet
* Add min/max exposure capability
